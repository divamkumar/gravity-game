# Gravity Game

## About
This is a C++ console game which runs on Windows (not cross-platform, sorry).
I made this game to practice my C++ skills. Enjoy!
NOTE: The game is still incomplete. I need to still add the obstacles. So far I have the main character able to perform gravity switches.

### How to Play
- Hit spacebar toggle gravity. 
- Avoid the obstacles.
- The score is the number of obstacles you avoid.
- If you hit any obstacle, the game is over.
- As your score gets higher, the speed of the game increases.

### Requirements
- Download the code
- Have C++ installed along with a compiler
- In the same directory with the downloaded code, build the file 
- Run the exe file using '.\gravity-game.exe'
